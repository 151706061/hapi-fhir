title: "Previously, when a search query explicitly included a search parameter that was for the same resource type but a
different resource instance from the one specified in the token, the search narrowing interceptor would include both search
parameters in the final query, resulting in an empty bundle being returned to the caller. Now, such a call will result in
a 403 Forbidden error, making it more clear why no resources were returned."
